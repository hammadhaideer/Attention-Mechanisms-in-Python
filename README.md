# Attention Mechanism Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of a basic attention mechanism for neural networks. The attention mechanism helps neural networks focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, enhancing their performance in tasks like sequence-to-sequence prediction and language modeling.

## Files

- `attention.py`: Implementation of the attention mechanism.
- `example.py`: Example usage demonstrating how to integrate and use the attention mechanism in a neural network.

## Implementation Details

The `attention.py` file provides a simple implementation of an attention mechanism. It initializes with a trainable weight matrix and computes attention weights using a dot product with input vectors, followed by normalization using softmax. The context vector is then computed as a weighted sum of input vectors based on these attention weights.

## Usage

### Example Usage

You can integrate the attention mechanism into your neural network models by using the `attention.py` module. Here's a basic example of how to use it:

```python
# example.py

import numpy as np
from attention import AttentionMechanism

# Example input data
inputs = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Initialize attention mechanism
attention = AttentionMechanism(input_dim=3, attention_units=2)

# Calculate attention
context_vector, attention_weights = attention.calculate_attention(inputs)

# Print results
print("Inputs:\n", inputs)
print("\nAttention Weights:\n", attention_weights)
print("\nContext Vector:\n", context_vector)

The example.py file demonstrates how to integrate and use the attention mechanism (AttentionMechanism) in a simple neural network scenario. Adjust the input data (inputs) based on your specific use case or experiment.
